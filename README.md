# Node.js Project
## Overview

This is a simple Node.js project that demonstrates basic concepts like module importing, directory exports, file system operations, and using external libraries.

## Features

1. **Module Importing**:
   - Import custom modules (`math.js`) and directories (`shelter`).

2. **Directory Exports**:
   - Use `index.js` to export multiple files from a directory.

3. **File System Operations**:
   - Create directories and files dynamically using the `fs` module (`nodeScript.js`).

4. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - Process and log command-line arguments (`args.js`).

5. **External Libraries**:
   - Fetch and display jokes in colorful output using `one-liner-joke` and `colors` libraries (`Jokester/index.js`).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project and install all necessary dependencies:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Misba0019/color_project.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Change into the main project directory:
```bash
cd color_project
```
3. **Install Main Project Dependencies**:
   Install the dependencies for the main project (if any are listed in the package.json file):
```bash
npm install
```
4. **Install Dependencies for the Jokester Subproject**:
   Navigate to the Jokester folder and install its dependencies
```bash
cd Jokester
npm install
cd ..
```

### Explanation of Each Step
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Downloads the project from GitHub to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Moves into the main project folder where the code is located.

3. **Install Main Project Dependencies**:
   - Runs `npm install` in the main project directory to install any dependencies listed in the `package.json` file (if applicable).

4. **Install Dependencies for the [Jokester](http://_vscodecontentref_/3) Subproject**:
   - Since the [Jokester](http://_vscodecontentref_/4) folder has its own `package.json` file, you need to navigate into that folder and run `npm install` to install its dependencies (e.g., `one-liner-joke`, `colors`).
